         <h1>Analysis of College Football Data</h1>
         <p>I am currently working on an analysis of College Football data from 2013-2020 for my STOR 320 class. When the final project is finished I will update it with the information, but for now here is my exploratory data analysis.  </p>
         <p>I looked at the data and asked the question: Can we quantify schools as “rushing oriented”, “passing oriented”, or “balanced” and conclude which group has the most success over time?</p>
         <img src = "img/followup1.png" alt="Visualization of Win.Percentage per year for balanced, rushing, and passing oriented teams" class = "image-project" >
         <p>From my visualization I can see that balanced teams tend to have a higher winning percentage.</p>
         <p>Next, I looked at the question: What variables are best at predicting how many games a team wins in a season? Can we create a model that can accurately use these variables to predict a team's wins?</p>
         <img src = "img/followup2.png" alt="Visualization of Actual Wins vs Predicted Wins" class = "image-project" >
         <p>Clearly, I developed a model that predicts wins accurately. This could be used by coaches, fans, and others to predict season outcomes.</p>

       <h1>Analysis of Rotten Tomatoes Data</h1>
       <p>I wanted to analyze the different ways that male reviewers looked at lower-rated movies that were either aimed at a female or male demographic. I hypothesized that there would be a higher rate of negative adjectives for the movies aimed at women. In the future, I want to broaden this project much more. I want to look at more movies and I want to include female reviwers in my analysis. For now, I looked at the top critic reviews for Fast and the Furious and Breaking Dawn Part 1. Both were huge financial successes and are ojectively cult-classics. However, fast and the furious was aimed at men whereas Breaking Dawn was aimed at women.</p> 

       <p>When I first looked at the output of the most common words in Fast and the Furious, the data wasn't all that useful. This is why I used a data set of words in the english language that included a frequency variable. I then joined this dataset with the ones that I had created for my movies. I created these initial visualizations that measured the most unique words in the reviews.</p>
       <h4>Frequent Words in Breaking Dawn Reviews</h4>
       <img src = "img/BW-BD.png" alt="Bar Chart of Breaking Dawn" class = "image-project" >
       <h4>Frequent Words in Fast and the Furious Reviews</h4>
       <img src = "img/BW-FF.png" alt="Bar Chart of Fast Furious" class = "image-project" >
       <p>As you can tell, these visualizations aren't so appealing. Here is what I created in my next step.</p>
       <h4>Breaking Dawn Word Cloud</h4>
       <img src = "img/BD-Cloud.png" alt="Word Cloud of Breaking Dawn"class = "image-project" >
       <h4>Fast and the Furious Word Cloud</h4>
       <img src = "img/FF-Cloud.png" alt = "Word Cloud of Fast Furious" class = "image-project">
       <p>I want to keep analyzing this data further but I can tell that I am already seeing results that I find fascinating. There is a clear distinct tone difference between the reviews for Breaking dawn and the reviews for Fast and the Furious. With further analysis, I will break down the exact proportions of negative vs positive adjectives to get a true quanitative answer to this question.</p>
